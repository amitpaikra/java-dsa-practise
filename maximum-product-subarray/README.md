# 📌 Understanding `maxProdOfSubArray` Function

This Java function calculates the **maximum product of any subarray** (a contiguous section of an array) from a given integer array.

---

## 💡 What Is a Subarray?

A **subarray** is a continuous portion of an array.  
Example: If the array is `[2, -3, 4]`, possible subarrays include `[2]`, `[-3, 4]`, `[2, -3, 4]`, etc.

---

## 🧠 What Is the Goal?

We want to find the **maximum product** that can be formed by multiplying the numbers in any subarray.

For example:
- In `[2, 3, -2, 4]`, the subarray `[2, 3]` has a product of `6`, which is the maximum.

## 🔍 How the Function Works

```java
private static int maxProdOfSubArray (int[] array, int n)
```

### Variables Used:

- `forPositiveEndingHere`: Keeps track of the **maximum positive product** ending at the current index.
- `forNegativeEndingHere`: Keeps track of the **minimum negative product** ending at the current index (important for flipping sign later).
- `maxResult`: The overall **maximum product** found so far.

## 🧭 Step-by-Step Logic

1. **Loop through the array** one element at a time.
2. For each element:
   - **If it's positive**:
     - Multiply it with the positive product so far.
     - Update the negative tracker carefully (min between 1 and previous * current).
   - **If it's negative**:
     - It could flip a negative product into a big positive!
     - Swap the logic: temp store the positive tracker, then update both trackers.
   - **If it's zero**:
     - Reset: because any subarray ending in 0 can't contribute to the max product.
3. After handling each number:
   - Check if the current `forPositiveEndingHere` is the largest so far.
4. Finally, return `maxResult`.

## 🧪 Example Walkthrough

For input: `[2, 3, -2, 4]`

- Start: `forPositiveEndingHere = 1`, `forNegativeEndingHere = 1`
- i=0, `2` → `forPositiveEndingHere = 2`, max = 2
- i=1, `3` → `forPositiveEndingHere = 6`, max = 6
- i=2, `-2` → neg number flips things → new max = 6
- i=3, `4` → max grows again

---

## ⚠️ Edge Cases Handled

- Negative numbers flipping signs
- Zeros resetting product
- Starting from scratch if needed

---

## ✅ Final Output

Returns the **maximum product** of any subarray in the input array.
